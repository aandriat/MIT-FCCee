Jet Algorithm Notes

Inclusive kt algorithm does not include dcut thus stores all particles as jets.
Possibility to use inclusive kt with only 2 jets for ee search

Can cluster exclusively but instead of dcut use exact number of jets

vector <PseudoJet> exclusive_jets (const int & njets) const

On page 14 
double exclusive_ymerge (int njets);
